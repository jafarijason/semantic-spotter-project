    "### ✂️ **Document Transformers / Text Splitters**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with long documents such as books, reports, or transcripts, the content is often **too large** to send to a language model in one go due to token limits. To address this, LangChain offers **text splitters** that break documents into smaller, manageable chunks—while attempting to preserve semantic coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These chunks can then be passed into LLMs or used in vector search systems as part of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Why Use Text Splitters?\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs have **token limits** on input size.\n",
    "- Smaller chunks enable more **accurate retrieval** and **context-aware generation**.\n",
    "- Splitting improves **embedding granularity** and model performance.\n",

    "### 🧩 Common Text Splitting Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides multiple text splitters that you can choose from depending on your needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Split by Character**\n",
    "- **Method**: Splits text based on a character pattern (default is `\"\\n\\n\"`).\n",
    "- **Chunk size measured by**: Number of characters.\n",
    "- **Use case**: Simple and fast; suitable for uniformly structured content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Recursive Text Splitter** (Recommended)\n",
    "- **Method**: Tries to split using a list of separators in descending order of granularity (default: `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]`).\n",
    "- **Chunk size measured by**: Number of characters.\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Preserves semantic relationships like paragraphs → sentences → words.\n",
    "- **Use case**: Generic text like blogs, news articles, or emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Token Splitter**\n",
    "- **Method**: Splits text based on token count, matching the tokenizer used by your LLM.\n",
    "- **Chunk size measured by**: Number of tokens.\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Ensures chunks remain under the model’s token limit.\n",
    "- **Use case**: When fine control over token usage is critical (e.g., OpenAI API requests).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔗 [Explore text splitting strategies in LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_splitters/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Tip**: The right splitter depends on your data type and model. Experiment with multiple approaches to find the optimal balance between chunk size, context, and semantic meaning.\n"
